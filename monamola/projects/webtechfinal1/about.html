			<h1>About</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>There is magic in clothing, we choose to wear what represents us<br> but also what remind us of what we love and what makes us feel more confident and ready to face the word.<br> 
			Out of fantasy worlds of wonderful authors, come wearable clothing.  
			The clothes are quality and the best.<br>You can find clothes inspired by Xhosa traditional lovers. 
			If you haven't seen them, please do and come back to see the designs with other eyes.<br> 
			You will be inspired too. Signature collection is inspired as mentioned before, by everything else, and mystical beliefs around the world. 
			Formal clothes for everyday wear</p>
			<br>
			<p>Inspired by my vision to create a morden Xhosa-inspired kintware collection that would be suitable for Xhosa initiates,<br>
			who are prescribed by tradition to dress up in new dignefied formal clothing for six months after intitationA celebration of dark skin tones<br> contrasted with bright
			hues to elevate the appreciation of colour diversity</p>
